The objective of this project is to predict the flight delay based on the data of 15
airports (refer in Table 1) in the United States of America using a pipeline model.
The project involves an extensive data acquisition and data preprocessing of
flight and weather data. A pipeline consisting of a classifier and a regressor
was modeled, built, and analyzed to predict the departure delay of flight. This
model predicts the delay in two steps, in the first step the classifier makes a
prediction about a possible delay and in the second step the regressor then goes
on to quantify the delay. The accuracy of the classifier and regressor were found
to be 86% and 92% respectively.
